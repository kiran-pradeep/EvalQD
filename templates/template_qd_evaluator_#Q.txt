You are an expert and smart linguist.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of predicted sub-questions for a given complex question using the provided context. The context contains all the information needed to answer the question and are unstructured (e.g., paragraphs or passages).
You must assess the sub-questions along five criteria: Relevance, Completeness, Granularity, Correctness, and Coherence.

Context:
{CONTEXT}

This context contains the information needed to answer the question. It includes unstructured data (e.g., passages or paragraphs) relevant to answering the original question.

Original Question:
{QUESTION}

Predicted Sub-questions:
{SUB_QUESTIONS}

Evaluation Criteria (with Definitions):
1. Relevance: For each sub-question, determine whether it is necessary for answering the original question using the provided context.
    - "relevant": The sub-question addresses an aspect of the original question.
    - "irrelevant": The sub-question does not contribute toward answering the original question.

2. Completeness: Evaluate whether the full set of sub-questions covers all the required information needed to answer the original question.
    - "complete": All necessary reasoning steps are included.
    - "incomplete": Some essential parts of the logic or information are missing.

3. Granularity: Judge the appropriateness of the number and detail level of the sub-questions.
    - "optimal": The number and scope of sub-questions are just right.
    - "over-decomposed": Too many sub-questions or unnecessarily fine-grained.
    - "under-decomposed": Too few sub-questions or lacking in logical breakdown.

4. Correctness: For each sub-question, assess whether it is factually and logically valid based on the original question and context.
    - "correct": Accurately framed and valid.
    - "incorrect": Contains factual errors, logical flaws, or misinterpretations.

5. Coherence: Evaluate whether the sub-question is clearly and logically worded.
    - "coherent": Grammatically correct, well-structured, and understandable.
    - "incoherent": Ambiguous, poorly phrased, or confusing.

Additional Notes:
- Sub-questions should represent distinct steps of reasoning or information retrieval that are needed to answer the original question.
- The goal is for the combined answers to the sub-questions to logically lead to the final answer.

Special Instruction:
- If any sub-question refers to another sub-question using the format #Q<integer> (e.g., #Q1), assume that the answer to that sub-question is known and available for use.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Explanation of the logical analysis that justifies the evaluation.",
  "relevance": {{
    "Sub-Question 1": "relevant" or "irrelevant",
    "Sub-Question 2": "relevant" or "irrelevant",
    ...
  }},
  "correctness": {{
    "Sub-Question 1": "correct" or "incorrect",
    "Sub-Question 2": "correct" or "incorrect",
    ...
  }},
  "coherence": {{
    "Sub-Question 1": "coherent" or "incoherent",
    "Sub-Question 2": "coherent" or "incoherent",
    ...
  }},
  "completeness": "complete" or "incomplete",
  "granularity": "optimal" or "over-decomposed" or "under-decomposed",
}}
```

Do not include any extra commentary or explanation. Return only the JSON.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.

Take a deep breath and think step by step. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars.
