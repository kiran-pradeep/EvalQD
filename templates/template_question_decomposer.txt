You are a smart and thoughtful language expert.
Your task is to decompose the original complex question into a sequence of intermediate sub-questions that help in answering it accurately and logically using the provided context.

Each sub-question should:
- Represent a minimal reasoning step.
- Help uncover or retrieve specific information needed to answer the final question.
- Be phrased clearly and independently.
- Build upon previous sub-questions if needed, using references like #Q1, #Q2, etc., where appropriate.

Context:
{CONTEXT}

This context contains all the information needed to answer the question. It may be unstructured (e.g., paragraphs or passages), and not all parts may be equally useful.

Original Question:
{QUESTION}

Instructions:
- Think carefully about what information is required to answer the question.
- Break the reasoning process down into a logical sequence of sub-questions.
- Each sub-question should retrieve or derive one useful piece of information.
- Use at least two sub-questions if the question is multi-hop in nature.
- If the answer to one sub-question is needed to generate the next, reference it with #Q<number> (e.g., “What is the birth year of #Q1?”).

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{{
  "sub_questions": ["Sub-Question 1", "Sub-Question 2", ...],
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation that shows how the sub-questions will help in deriving the final answer."
}}
```

Do not include any extra commentary or explanation. Return only the JSON.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.

Take a deep breath and think step by step. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars.
