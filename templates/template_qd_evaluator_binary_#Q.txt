You are an expert and smart linguist.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of predicted sub-questions for a given complex question using the provided context. The context contains all the information needed to answer the question and are unstructured (e.g., paragraphs or passages).
You must assess the sub-questions along five criteria: Relevance, Completeness, Granularity, Correctness, and Coherence.

Context:
{CONTEXT}

This context contains the information needed to answer the question. It includes unstructured data (e.g., passages or paragraphs) relevant to answering the original question.

Original Question:
{QUESTION}

Predicted Sub-questions:
{SUB_QUESTIONS}

Evaluation Criteria (Definitions):
1. Relevance: Does each sub-question contribute toward answering the original question?
2. Completeness: Do the sub-questions collectively cover all necessary information?
3. Granularity: Are the sub-questions broken down at an appropriate level (not too fine or too coarse)?
4. Correctness: Are the sub-questions factually and logically accurate?
5. Coherence: Are the sub-questions clearly and logically worded?

Additional Notes:
- Sub-questions should represent distinct steps of reasoning or information retrieval that are needed to answer the original question.
- The goal is for the combined answers to the sub-questions to logically lead to the final answer.

Special Instruction:
- If any sub-question refers to another sub-question using the format #Q<integer> (e.g., #Q1), assume that the answer to that sub-question is known and available for use.

Final Evaluation:
- "correct" if all sub-questions are correct and logically sufficient to answer the question using the given context.
- "incorrect" if any sub-question is incorrect, irrelevant, incoherent, incomplete, or if the overall set fails to meet completeness or granularity requirements.


Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Explanation of the logical analysis that justifies the evaluation.",
  "evaluation": "correct" or "incorrect",
}}
```

Do not include any extra commentary or explanation. Return only the JSON.
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.

Take a deep breath and think step by step. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars.
